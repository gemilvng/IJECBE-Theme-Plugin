# IJECBE-Theme-Plugin
## On Going
- [ ] Examine `bootstrap3/templates/` and make observation log. (Currently writing [README.md](IJECBE-Plugin-Theme/bootstrap3/templates/README.md)).
## To-Do
- [ ] Examine `bootstrap3/boostrap/` and make observation log.
- [ ] Examine `bootstrap3/boostrap-themes/` and make observation log.
- [ ] Examine `bootstrap3/styles/` and make observation log.
- [ ] Map the interaction between files inside `bootstrap3/templates/`, `bootstrap3/boostrap/`, `bootstrap3/boostrap-themes/` and `bootstrap3/styles/`.
## Done
- [x] Rename `ijecbe/Bootstrap3ThemePlugin.php` to `IJECBEThemePlugin.php`
- [x] Edit the file so that it appears as new theme while preserving the functionality and behavior of the new theme (we will handle it later)
- [x] Edit `ijecbe/version.xml` to adjust the metadata
- [x] Edit `ijecbe/index.php` because you need to
- [x] Test it by adding it to main local OJS repo. Expected result: The theme listed as whole different theme but preserve Bootstrap3 Base Theme behavior and functionality. **Result: Successful.**
