# IJECBE-Theme-Plugin
---
## To-Do 17-03-2025
- [x] Rename `ijecbe/Bootstrap3ThemePlugin.php` to `IJECBEThemePlugin.php`
- [x] Edit the file so that it appears as new theme while preserving the functionality and behavior of the new theme (we will handle it later)
- [ ] Edit `ijecbe/version.xml` to adjust the metadata
- [ ] Edit `ijecbe/index.php` because you need to
- [ ] Test it by adding it to main local OJS repo. Expected result: The theme listed as whole different theme but preserve Bootstrap3 Base Theme behavior and functionality.
- [ ] Find a way how to reduce the alternative theme options to simplify it
